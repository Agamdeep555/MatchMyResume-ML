# MatchMyResume - Machine Learning Component

## üéØ Project Overview

**MatchMyResume** is an AI-powered job search platform that streamlines the entire job hunting process by finding relevant jobs, tailoring resumes with AI, preparing personalized interview questions, and sending instant WhatsApp alerts.

## ü§ñ My Contribution as ML Developer

As the **Machine Learning Developer** for this hackathon project, I designed and implemented the core intelligent matching system that powers MatchMyResume's job recommendation engine.

### Key ML Responsibilities

- **Job-Resume Matching Algorithm**: Developed an advanced machine learning model that analyzes job descriptions and user profiles to calculate compatibility scores
- **Skill Similarity Analysis**: Implemented NLP-based skill extraction and similarity calculation using job description text
- **Intelligent Ranking System**: Created a multi-factor scoring algorithm that combines skill similarity and description matching to generate final scores
- **Resume Optimization Engine**: Built the backend ML pipeline that identifies key areas for resume customization based on job requirements

## üìä Model Performance & Results

### Matching Algorithm Output

The ML model successfully processes and ranks job opportunities based on:
- **Skill Similarity Percentage**: Measures alignment between user skills and job requirements
- **Description Similarity Percentage**: Analyzes semantic similarity between user profile and job description
- **Final Score**: Weighted combination providing comprehensive job-fit ranking

### Sample Results

| Rank | Job Title | Skill Match | Description Match | Final Score |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Python Development | 100.00% | 46.51% | 83.89 |
| 2 | Web Development | 100.00% | 27.44% | 78.23 |
| 3 | Artificial Intelligence (AI) | 83.33% | 60.26% | 76.41 |
| 4 | Desktop Support | 100.00% | 19.57% | 75.87 |
| 5 | My Job | 100.00% | 7.04% | 72.11 |

*Top 5 matches shown from 40+ analyzed job positions*

### Model Capabilities
